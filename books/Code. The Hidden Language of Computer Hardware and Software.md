## Chapter Eight. Relays and Gates

> Reduced to its essentials, a computer is a synthesis of Boolean algebra and electricity. 

Logic gates block or let through the flow of electrical current. Showing how to simplify logical expressions by rewriting, using distributive law, etc. Input device (ex: a board of switches), output device (ex.: a lightbulb).

Relays could be used to perform Boolean operations: described by Claude Elwood Shannon, 1938; several years earlier by a Japanese electrical engineer Akira Nakashima.

Simplification: an electric circuit relay with a magnet, replacing batterie's minuses with ground, replacing trigger and bulb with abstract input and output. Moving to cascaded relays.
