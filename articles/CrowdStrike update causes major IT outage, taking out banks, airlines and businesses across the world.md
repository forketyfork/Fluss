More news similar to [[Major Windows BSOD issue takes banks, airlines, and broadcasters offline]]. It's crazy how one IT company can cause so much damage, and not even a very publicly known one. This is apparently some Kernel module, as the tech alert proposes to remove a sys file in the drivers directory. I hope Microsoft will do something with their system APIs and update rollouts to prevent such shit show in the future.
