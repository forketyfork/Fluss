Microsoft's Copilot hallucinated that a German court reporter was himself guilty of crimes that he reported. 

>Bernklau had regularly reported on criminal trials involving abuse, violence, and fraud, and his stories were published in national and international newspapers. His articles must presumably have been included in the language corpus which uses specific words relating to the nature of the cases. Because Bernklau spent years reporting in courts, when Copilot is asked about him, the most probable words associated with his name relate to the crimes he has covered.

It's ridiculous that someone still considers LLMs to be able to think and reason.
