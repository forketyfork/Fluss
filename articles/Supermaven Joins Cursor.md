Supermaven joins Cursor:

>Supermaven is a fast, context-aware copilot. Its creator, Jacob Jackson, kickstarted the modern wave of AI coding tools by inventing Tabnine in 2019 and through pioneering work at OpenAI.

Interesting, will they keep the plugins for JetBrains IDEs and Neovim?

>Will the plugin remain up? Yes! Weâ€™re happy to report that the Supermaven plugin will remain maintained, though Cursor will be the core focus.
