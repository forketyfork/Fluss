In Japan, people are no longer expected to submit official documents on floppy disks, thanks to Digital Minister Taro Kono. "We have won the war on floppy disks!" Now on to the faxes, which are also still extensively used. As the traditional carved personal hanko stamps.

The last floppy disks were manufactured by Sony in 2011. Remembering how little they lasted, I'm surprised some of them are still alive.

I was also surprised that the last pager service in Japan was active until 2019.
