The author debates the need to split people into "technical" and "non-technical", arguing that all our skills are in fact "technical". 

She starts with mentioning the movie she watched, [Free Solo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7775622/), about a guy who climbs El Capitan without a rope and alone, and her friend said something like "it was cool to see technical details" at the end.

Offhand mention of an arrow in the FedEx logo — although she says you'll never be able to un-see it, I knew that before and forgot about it already :D

Then she goes on a tangent with some long basketball reference parable, and I just can’t keep up because I know nothing about sports :D Sounds to me like: "Johnny Badger scored six twitch on a fifteen mid-field during the quarter-blip-shot in the finals, and you know how he did that? Technical skills!" Okay, I'll allow it.

Then she makes the main point of the article: technical skills are the skills used to produce the work. She describes them as underrated. Technical skills are part of everyone’s job, be it an HR, a manager, or a software developer. Every profession has those.

Noticing new skills and knowing there's something to learn is a prerequisite for learning.

>We often dismiss skills that are not societally valued by pretending they are not skills. Or, sure, maybe they're skills, but they're mysterious and ineffable!
>You reinforce this idea each time you say **"soft skills"** instead of working to enumerate them. Perhaps you mean "interpersonal skills," "leadership skills," or "communication skills." These are all technical skills, and they all have names.

So the point here is, be more precise with the naming of the skills, otherwise you may sound dismissive about them.

> **strategic incompetence**: when you let yourself believe that doing laundry, taking meeting notes, or organizing a birthday card for a coworker are things that some people "are naturally good at" and you are "just not good at."

"Strategic incompetence" — nice.

Then she goes on a tangent about sewing — also very technical, not unlike the "maker movement", which she describes as "arts and crafts, but for boys".

The general point of the article is to replace "technical/non-technical" with something else, although she doesn't propose anything, only that the "technical skills" in the world of software development usually means "software skills".
