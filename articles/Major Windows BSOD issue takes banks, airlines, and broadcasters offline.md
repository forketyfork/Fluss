CrowdStrike released a faulty update of their Falcon security system, and it made a lot of Windows PCs to crash. They reverted the update, but the affected PCs have to be revived manually. They say you can just delete some file on the disk if you boot into the safe mode. Still, a lot of the services are affected, trains, airports, even some emergency services in the US.

It turns out that the Azure issues are related to a different matter, just a coincidence.
