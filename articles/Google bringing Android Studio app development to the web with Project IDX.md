Google now supports Android Studio in their IDX project. It's very interesting how they managed to put this IDE into a browser. Is this just a video streaming?

Unfortunately, it's not yet possible to try this to figure it out, as this feature is under a waiting list.

The announcement was made at the I/O Connect Bengaluru 2024, here: [I/O Connect | Bengaluru 2024 - Opening remarks](https://www.youtube.com/live/gZ4smF6p7l0?si=bLZz92u3ZfKEn142&t=2015)

They already have a video-streamed iOS/Android emulator support, and it's quite laggy. I wonder if they use the same technology to stream the UI of Android Studio.
