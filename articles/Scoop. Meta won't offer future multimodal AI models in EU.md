> Meta will withhold its next multimodal AI model — and future ones — from customers in the European Union because of what it says is a lack of clarity from regulators there,

Just like Apple did with their AI. It's interesting, who will win in the end — people in the EU due to better regulations, better guarded privacy, better tech policies, or people elsewhere, having access to the latest AI models due to the lack of regulations.

> Meta plans to incorporate the new multimodal models, which are able to reason across video, audio, images and text, in a wide range of products, including smartphones and its Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses.

Everyone is so hellbent on including AI into everything, I really hope this trend dies off in a couple of years.

> A Meta representative told Axios that training on European data is key to ensuring its products properly reflect the terminology and culture of the region.

CULTURE OF THE REGION

I say good riddance.
