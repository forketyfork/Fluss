The author describes the overwhelming focus of AWS on GenAI that was apparent at re:Invent 2023 and other conferences. Everything is about GenAI, all keynotes and product announcements revolve around GenAI. It's as if they don't care about scalability, performance, reliability, security, etc., except in the context of GenAI.

> AWS’ focus on GenAI took on hysterical proportions

This is true for many companies. But I also remember the last re:Invent was heavily GenAI focused, so much that it was hard to find anything not related to AI there. This is a very sad tendency in general. I would like most of my news to not be related to AI, but that would probably take a couple of years for this hype to die out.
