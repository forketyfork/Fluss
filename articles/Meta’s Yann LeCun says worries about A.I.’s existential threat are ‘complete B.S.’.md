Yann LeCun, Turing Award winner and a senior researcher at Meta, is very skeptic that the current state of AI is remotely close to superintelligence or AGI. 

>before we worry about controlling super-intelligent AI, “we need to have the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat.”

In a WSJ article, he called the idea of AI becoming a threat to humanity "a complete B.S." LLMs lack "persistent memory, reasoning, planning, and an understanding the physical world". 

> LLMs merely demonstrate that “you can manipulate language and not be smart” and will never lead to true artificial general intelligence (AGI)"
