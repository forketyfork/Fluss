I wonder why Primeogen starts with discussing servers, I was under the impression that the issue mostly hit the end user Windows devices. He says "destroys internet", but it's not the Internet that was destroyed, it's the end devices.

Rants about "United" airlines, compares them to Spirit that say "Welcome, bitch" and throw some peanuts at you :D

"Isn't EU all about privacy and safety?" Ahahahahahaha, man

Invites [John Hammond](https://twitter.com/_johnhammond) to his stream. Funny that they both have no idea what a "dodgy channel file" is, looks like it's just a technical report MacGuffin. Primeogen keeps calling it "anti-cheat" software.

They often mention Jia Tan who tried to hack xz, this is now like a household name for a "very clever hacker".

"ClownStrike", hehe

Why didn't they do a gradual rollout? Now everyone needs a lot of manual effort to recovery.
